# Semler.Canteen.Lunch 

This project is for recruitment processes only and is not intended for any live production environments.

## Features

- As a Semler employee, I’d like to order lunch for the next time I’m at the office premises
- As a Semler employee, I’d like to see my future orders, for overview and validation purposes

### Business rules

- Lunch must be ordered no later than 2 days in advance
- Lunch must be ordered to only one of the following locations (Park Alle 355, Park Alle 354, Park Alle 350, Banemarks vej 16, Banemarksvej 4)

## New feature requirement and tasks

The new feature requirements below are NOT implemented in the solution and they’re expected to be completed by the next interview

- As a Semler employee, to avoid food waste I’d like to delete my lunch order, as I won’t be at the office after all
- As a Semler employee, I shouldn’t be able to select weekends (Saturday, Sunday), as this is outside office hours and the canteen is closed 

The changes can be delivered either as a pull-request or via e-mail to then@semler.dk.

Furthermore you can expect to be questioned about the structure of the solution and if there’s anything, you would’ve done differently

## Installation 

The solution can be run with Visual Studio 2019 or with the dotnet cli

``` 
  dotnet run -p Semler.Canteen.Lunch.Web/Semler.Canteen.Lunch.Web.csproj
```
